just checking if editing with notepad after using touch to create this will work
It seems that it does, am now editing it in RStudio using the Markdown language
#First level heading
##Second level  heading
###Third level heading
The heading levels were done in RStudio, and now am adding a list in Notepad++
*item 1
*item 2
*item 3
